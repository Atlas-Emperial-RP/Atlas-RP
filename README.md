Optional: Scroll throught th extentions and see what you think will be the most useful for yourself.
Optional: This is a [cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to make readme better looking in your own branch.

### What does what:

#### Before going and doing something about and issue with the code make a report in [issues](https://github.com/yairme/Atlas-RP/issues)
#### No one will directly change anything of the main branch, until it passes through a [pull request](https://github.com/yairme/Atlas-RP/pulls)
#### We will document things of what we have in the [wiki](https://github.com/yairme/Atlas-RP/wiki)

## Important!!

### When going to work anything to do with programming either adding or removing code, make a [branch](https://github.com/yairme/Atlas-RP/branches) then work on the branch, to add it then make a pull request.

## There will be more done here, as for now this is all I can think of.
